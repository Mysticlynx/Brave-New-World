    <string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionMilitia" value="A millennia-old concept, the term 'militia' describes a group of citizens in country armed and trained for military or paramilitary duties. Though notoriously unreliable and less well-trained than traditional soldiers, the militia can provide a valuable service by supplementing regular divisions. Armies in the 20th century tend to use less of these soldiers, but in desperate times nations can call on their militia again to fight against the enemy."/>

    <string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionRegularInfantry" value="Infantry divisions played a critical role during the First World War: much of the war centered on the mass movement of infantry from defensive positions. Post-War infantry still use the tactics and equipment of 1918, universally using bolt action rifles with limited support from machine guns. Effective when used en masse in concert with artillery, these units rely on outdated 19th century tactics and weaponry and may prove ineffective as technology advances further."/>

Using improved weapons and training instituted following the Great War, these new units are capable of moving on horseback and quickly attacking enemy units. These units, nevertheless, remain best over fast distances where armor and mechanized units would require far too much maintenance to maintain, instead of the simple requirements of grazing."/>

    <string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionAirborneInfantry" value="Paratroopers are infantry units charged with landing via parachute onto the battlefield in order to quickly surprise the enemy. The years after World War I saw extensive progress in developing paratrooper divisions.

Popular throughout the 19th century, advances in modern weaponry have rendered many of these units obsolete. Nevertheless, they proved their utility in battle in such regions as Russia and Eastern Europe during the post-World War I years where mobility was prized as crucial to the war effort."/>
    <string id="SID.UI.GunHowitzer" value="Gun Howitzer"/>
    <string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionGunHowitzer" value="Gun Howitzers are artillery pieces which fire small rounds of artillery at a steep trajectories and angles of descent. These artillery pieces can be well suited for offensive infantry support, but are most effective in a defensive role, when they can saturate a pre-targeted area as an enemy enters it.  Their weight requires a motorized vehicle to tow them into postion."/>

    <string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionHeavyArtillery" value="These artillery units are typically used for direct fire against heavily armed or defended targets.

    <string id="SID.UI.LightTanks" value="Light Tanks"/>
    <string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionLightTanks" value=" Light tanks are the smallest of modern tank classifications: these tanks are often lightweight and armed with either a small cannon or powerful machine gun. The military often uses these vehicles for reconnaissance maneuvers and for quick raids and assaults against enemy lines. Often used in concert with infantry, these tanks can launch lightning fast strikes against the enemy, but can run into trouble when faced with modern tanks and anti-tank weapons."/>

    <string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionMediumTanks" value="Medium tanks are, in many ways, the happy medium of tanks: armed with capable firepower, a powerful engine, and substantial armor, this tank has the capacity to serve as in an anti-personnel and anti-tank role. These tanks, when massed, can overwhelm even the most powerful of fortifications, artillery pieces, or tanks. Though not possessing the maneuverability of light tanks nor the firepower and armor of heavy tanks, medium tanks are capable in all battles and can easily turn the tide of battle."/>

These tanks remain committed to attacking entrenched positions and other tanks, yet are much more effective in these roles and others."/>
    <string id="SID.UI.SuperHeavyTanks" value="Super Heavy Tank"/>
    <string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionSuperheavyTanks" value="These tanks, typically weighing over 75 tons, are armored behemoths intended to decimate enemy fortifications and formations. Typically heavily armed and armored, these tanks are able to punch through other enemy armor and easily crush any enemy defenses. However, these tanks tend to be extremely slow and are vulnerable to concentrated enemy firepower or airpower."/>

    <string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionMotorizedInfantry" value="Motorized infantry are typical soldiers, armed with a mixture of rifles, submachine guns, and machine guns.

This mobility enables these soldiers to deploy quickly and easily outmaneuver any enemy force devoid of mechanized units."/>
    <string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionObservationBlimp" value="Since the dawn of aerial balloon flight, balloons and blimps have been used to aid in military operations, including actions as early as the wars of the French Revolution. The Great War's focus on artillery power necessitated the use of balloons throughout the Western Front in order to spot and direct artillery barrages. Typically filled with hydrogen and enclosed with specially sealed fabric, these weak yet crucial blimps still serve a vital role spotting artillery and locating enemy submarines."/>
    <string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionBomberAirships" value="Beginning in the late nineteenth century, military planners saw rigid airships as one of the next innovations in army and air warfare. These massive dirigibles could travel enormous distances and, as evidenced by the use of zeppelins by Germany during the Great War, launch bombing raids deep into enemy territory. Advances in aerial technology have made these airships sturdier and better defended. Will they continue to serve a critical role in combat in the future?"/>
    <string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionBiPlaneFighters" value="The first major military fighter aircraft, the biplane fighter dominated the skies over the battlefields of the Great War. These aircraft, when compared to monoplanes of the era, typically possess greater maneuverability and lighter wing structures. However, due to structural weaknesses of these fighters, advances in air technology tend to favor monoplanes. While cheaper than modern aircraft, will military planners continue to use the dogfighters of the Great War?"/>
    <string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionBiPlaneBombers" value="First used in the Italo-Turkish War of 1911, biplane bombers tend to be larger and heavier than the smaller, lightweight biplane fighters. In order to carry a sufficient load of bombs, these aircraft typically have multiple engines and, in order to compensate for their size making them a large target, are lightly armed against enemy fighters. These bombers, though, are limited to attacking enemy positions and industrial regions."/>
    <string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionEarlyFighters" value="Early Fighters, some of the original military monoplanes developed during and after the Great War, have begun to become the core aircraft of any nation's air corps. Better armed, armored, and faster than biplanes, these aircraft are capable of flying longer distances and easily downing enemy biplanes. However, these planes remain very experimental and remain somewhat unreliable, sometimes having landing problems or are difficult to control."/>
    <string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionEarlyBombers" value="As biplane technology gave way to monoplanes, bombers followed suit and began to adopt monoplane constructions in order to mitigate many of the deficiencies of biplane aircraft. In due course, these new, experimental monoplane bombers can carry a larger payload than their biplane predecessors, yet remain fragile and dangerous to operate due to their experimental nature. Furthermore, these bombers are relatively undefended and lightly armed, requiring them fighter protection if they are to be used in military combat."/>
    <string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionBasicFighters" value="Basic fighters are full metal monoplane aircraft that form the core of any modern air corps. Armed with machine guns and, at times, cannons and well-defended compared to their earlier predecessors, these aircraft are tasked with achieving aerial superiority over their foes and eliminating enemy bombers and fighters. These aircraft, furthermore, are well-suited to escort roles in order to protect friendly bombers, yet should avoid ground attack roles due to the limitations of their armaments payload."/>
    <string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionLightBombers" value="Light bombers are bomber aircraft whose maximum payload typically does not go above two tons of ordinance. These aircraft, typically only single-engine airplanes, were tasked with providing ground interdiction and dive bombing actions. These aircraft can be a part of aircraft carrier wings, due to their small size, or serve as part of a combined arms approach to decimate enemy troops."/>
    <string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionEarlyCarrierFighters" value="The first aircraft deployed by naval units were either balloons or aircraft specifically outfitted for naval patrols. With the advent of aircraft carriers, though, ships can now deploy biplanes and monoplanes from their decks. These aircrafts, in order to accommodate the small size of these carriers, must be organized in smaller squadrons and are outfitted with bombs and torpedoes. Carrier aircraft can, as well, serve an air superiority role on the ocean."/>
    <string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionBasicCarrierFighters" value="An advance in the technology used for earlier carrier planes, Basic Carrier Fighters have increased range and do more damage than their predecessors. While reasonably effective for dogfighting or strafing ground targets, their inability to mount heavier bombs or torpedoes means they are ineffective in causing damage to ships. They can also be used in an air superiority or reconnaissance role."/>
    <string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionImprovedCarrierFighters" value="Advanced carrier fighters have benefited from advancements in engine technology that has substantially increased their range from their carrier and allowed them greater flexibility in attacking enemy ships and aircraft. Furthermore, armed with heavier armaments and armor, these aircraft are more than a match for anti-air defenses of ships and aircraft, both sea and land-based. Ultimately, these planes can serve a vital offensive and defensive role and ensure that carriers serve as the cornerstone of any nation's navy."/>
    <string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionMediumBomber" value="These planes combine the armor, payload, and multi-engine power of a bomber with some of the handling characteristics typical of heavy fighters. They are used for everything from typical bombing runs against fixed targets, to ground attacks against ships, submarines and land forces. Besides being capable of carrying significant bomb payloads, they are often bristling with all kinds of weapons, such as turret mounted guns, cannons, torpedoes and missiles. Their longer ranges and ability to absorb more damage and continue flying makes them extremely valuable as reconnaissance aircraft."/>
    <string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionEarlyNavalBombers" value="Late in the First World War, it became clear that not only could planes be used to bomb ground targets, but some sea targets, like transports, were particularly vulnerable to bombing by air as well. These early naval bombers were not much different than their land counterparts and lacked sea-based weapons, but still could wreak havoc on the right prey."/>
    <string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionBasicNavalBombers" value="Improvements in plane designs and the introduction of basic air-to-sea weapons has produced a bomber that can terrorize most ships currently on the water. While these naval bombers are better than the previous generation, they still suffer from limited range and protection from other enemy planes or anti-aircraft fire."/>
    <string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionImprovedNavalBombers" value="Continuing advances in aircraft design and anti-ship armaments has produced a bomber capable of causing great havoc amongst most seagoing vessels of the day. It also has some limited maneuverability and protection, which can help it evade enemy fighters and survive all but the most determined anti-aircaft defense."/>
    <string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionHeavyFighters" value="Sometimes a fighter is needed that can fulfill more than one role with competence. These heavy fighters can be used as light ground attack craft, interceptors, or occasionally fill a naval attack role. While they are not as effective as specialized aircraft, they are a good choice in situations where multiple roles may need to be filled."/>
    <string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionHeavyBombers" value="Heavy bombers are bomber aircraft whose payload exceeds four tons of ordinance and is, by far, one of the largest classes of aircraft. These aircraft have very long ranges and are best used for attacking enemy infrastructure and industry in order to destroy an enemy nation's economy. Furthermore, these aircraft are typically provided with excellent anti-fighter countermeasures: in a group, they can be virtually unstoppable against enemy cities."/>
    <string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionImprovedFighters" value="Outfitted with improved engines, armor, and weapons, these sleeker fighter aircraft are better suited for air superiority and reconnaissance activities than their predecessors. Typically, these aircraft have longer ranges and greater firepower than previous incarnations and are thus able to inflict greater damage against their foes. Their main role remains taking down enemy fighters and protecting bombers, yet these aircraft could even participate in ground attack missions."/>
    <string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionAdvancedFighters" value="Representing a major advance in fighter technology, these fighter aircraft use vastly improved piston engines, armor, and weapons to serve as an excellent air superiority fighter. Lesser fighters and bombers are no match for these agile and lethal aircraft. Excellent for reconnaissance and air superiority missions, these aircraft are also effective against ground and naval forces."/>
    <string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionStrategicBombers" value="Strategic Bombers are the longest range combat aircraft available to a nation: with these bombers, a nation truly has the capacity to strike deep within the heart of enemy territory and overwhelm enemy industry. These bombers typically are large and heavily-armed and capable of fending off interceptor aircraft even without air cover. These aircraft, furthermore, are perfectly suited for delivering massive payloads as part of an air armada and, if need be, dropping a nuclear weapon deep in the heart of enemy territory."/>
    <string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionEarlyJetFighters" value="Jet technology has been experimented with aircraft since the years prior to the Great War. As technology has advanced and jet engine became more feasible for travel with aircraft, the military has looked into creating new jet-powered aircraft in order to quickly outrun enemy aircraft in combat. With these first jet fighters, though fragile and dangerous, the world's air corps have acquired a fighter aircraft much faster than typical piston-driven fighters. These interception and escort fighters, thus, possess great potential as part of a country's war effort."/>
    <string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionBasicJetFighters" value="These standard jet fighters have benefited from improvements in turbo engines and sturdier hulls in order to improve the speed and strength of these aircraft. Faster and more durable, these fighters can provide excellent interception and protection capabilities and can easily outmaneuver other aircraft. Perhaps soon our aircraft will be able to breach the sound barrier and travel at extraordinary speeds in order to defeat opponents."/>
    <string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionJetBombers" value="Jet Bombers are outfitted with the latest in turbojet technology in order to rapidly deliver heavy payloads against enemy industry or positions. These jets are typically outfitted best for ground attack missions against enemy troops or against the industrial heartland of different nations. However, their speed has led many nations to avoid providing countermeasures such as machine guns or missiles: these bombers should thus only be paired with jet fighter cover lest enemy anti-air or aircraft down them."/>
    <string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionImprovedJetFighters" value="Following the successful breaking of the sound barrier, jet fighters now have the capacity to travel at flight speeds reaching and slightly exceeding the speed of sound. These fighters have allowed our engineers to determine the necessary engine and hull requirements in order to ensure that these jet fighters remain stable, thereby increasing the speed and defense of these planes. Piston-engine fighters now, however, are faced with an immense challenge against these maneuverable and powerful aircraft."/>
    <string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionAdvancedJetFighters" value="Our efforts at replicating transonic flight have allowed for the creation of the supersonic jet fighters. Possessing dramatically high speeds of flight, these craft can quickly deliver their payload and decimate opponents in the air, and on the sea and land. These versatile fighters can thus serve in ground attack, air superiority, and reconnaissance roles."/>
    <string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionLightGlider" value="Gliders are an inexpensive, efficient, and most importantly, silent method of delivering airborne troops to a battlefield. Used throughout the entire war, they were gradually replaced by powered transport aircraft that had more carrying capacity and range. Gliders used to land troops disappear after use, since they are generally not recoverable."/>
    <string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionAirTransport" value="As the war continued, the need to deliver elite airborne troops to distant battles gave rise to the Air Transport. These units can carry dozens of soldiers, and even armored vehicles to a theater through conventional landings, or by paradrop. While they have speed and range advantages, they can be vulnerable to enemy fighters and ground fire."/>
    <string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionGuidedBombs" value="These weapons are missiles/bombs which are guided either by radio control or wire guidance. These bombs have the capacity to travel through the air to strike any target within range. They can do significant damage to cities, resource producers and other region improvements."/>
    <string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionBallisticMissiles" value="Ballistic missiles are a substantial improvement over battlefield missiles and guided bombs: these weapons are able to be fired distances of hundreds of miles from deep within one's territory to hit cities or military formations. Capable of carrying massive destructive payloads, these missiles can substantially disrupt daily life in population centers with impunity."/>
    <string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionICBMs" value="Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles are a fearsome weapon: able to travel distances thousands of miles, these missiles are a potent weapon against any city or army wherever they may be in the world. Using standard explosives, these weapons can be a potent weapon for bombardment or terror against enemy cities. Nuclear warheads can also be used in these missiles: one can only imagine the destruction that could be wrought using this weapon."/>
    <string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionFissionBombs" value="The fission nuclear bomb seeks to create a massive explosion using energy derived from splitting the nucleus of an atom into smaller parts. This process creates a chain reaction wherein a massive amount of energy is produced that propels the explosive power of the bomb. These bombs truly are weapons of mass destruction: they are capable of devastating armies, cities, and navies with the initial explosion and leaving dangerous, debilitating fallout that can weaken and destroy life and make key enemy regions impassable. One bomb could easily kill hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people."/>
    <string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionHydrogenBombs" value="Hydrogen bombs, using a mixture of heavy hydrogen isotopes, do the reverse of fission bombs: nuclear fusion. In the process of nuclear fusion, the fusion process creates a chain reaction that ultimately more than double the energy release of fission bombs. In due course, the destructive potential of hydrogen bombs is massive: a nation can easily eliminate vast armies, armadas, or metropolises in the blink of an eye, leaving nuclear devastation and destruction affecting the country for years to come."/>
    <string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionAttackSubmarines" value="Submarines traditionally had a role restricted mainly to harassing enemy shipping and providing a 'credible threat' for larger ships. A new specialized type of submarine, the attack submarine, can be used to directly attack other subs and provide a more effective anti-submarine defense."/>
    <string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionIroncladFrigate" value="The invention of the modern torpedo in 1860 represented a major fleet to navies around the world. As technology advanced and small, fast-moving ships could rapidly deploy torpedoes against fleets at sea, many navies created ships that would serve to guard battle fleets against these vessels. These torpedo boat destroyers were armed with light cannons and torpedoes and, while effective against these smaller vessels in tandem with large armadas, these ships are no match for the modern navies of the early to mid-20th century."/>
    <string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionTroopships" value="Although ships have conveyed soldiers for centuries, the demands of ever-increasing armies placed a major burden on navies. In attempting to catch up to this demand, troopships, typically civilian steam and ocean liners, were commissioned by modern navies. Often lightly armed, these ships would not land soldiers directly on the shore. Instead, they functioned in carrying thousands of soldiers directly into port and unloading them, allowing them to commence land operations."/>
    <string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionEarlyDestroyers" value="A ship class dating back to the seventeenth century, the corvette serves as a light, sleek, and effective escort and patrol vessel. Recently imperial powers have used EarlyDestroyers in conjunction with coastal gunboats in order to suppress colonial insurrections. Recently, following the hostilities of the First World War, this vessel has been reconsidered for convoy defense and protection and, at times, for open seas combat as part of a larger naval armada."/>
    <string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionFastAttackCraft" value="PT Boats, or Patrol Torpedo Boats, are small, fast, and well-armed ships used to harass and destroy larger vessels. Descended from the torpedo boats of the nineteenth century, these swift boats are capable of launching devastating torpedo attacks against fleets and even fending off enemy aircraft. However, their size, though making them a small target, still leaves them very vulnerable and capable of being easily destroyed."/>
    <string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionDestroyers" value="As technology and armaments have improved, the role of the torpedo boat destroyer has evolved. At first consigned to the role of protecting fleets from torpedo attack, this evolution in destroyer, aptly known as destroyers, features increased number of torpedo mounts in addition to heavier guns and armor plating. While these ships work best when in conjunction with the fleet, their improved lethality allows them to break away from the convoy in order to attack enemy ships themselves or even reconnaissance enemy coasts and waters."/>
    <string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionBattlecruiser" value="The Battlecruiser, introduced by the Royal Navy during the early 20th century, was an evolution in warship technology in line with the focus on heavy weaponry ushered in by the Dreadnought-class warships. Originally known as dreadnought cruisers, battlecruisers were as heavily armed ships as dreadnoughts or battleships, yet traded off those ships' armor for a more powerful engine and sleeker hull. While these ships were thus quite maneuverable and fast, they were vulnerable to heavy firepower from similarly armed ships, forcing them into an ancillary role in fleets to the more well-protected warships."/>
    <string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionDreadnought" value="The Dreadnought, descended from the British Dreadnought class vessel created in 1906, uses all big guns as armament and is driven by steam turbine propulsion. These vessels served as the mainstay of fleets during the First World War as the Great Powers raced to develop these large ships in order to demolish other navies in combat. However, following the limitations of the Washington Treaty and naval military advances, the Dreadnought, while still a fearsome vessel in combat, has become increasingly obsolescent. Some theorize that even more powerful warships will outclass these vessels."/>
    <string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionLightCarrier" value="Some of the first aircraft carriers were little more than cruiser hulls outfitted to accommodate these new ships and their primitive carrier planes. Although still an effective warship, the light carrier typically possesses a small number of carrier planes and only light anti-aircraft defense. They thus make easy targets outside of a well-protected fleet: a few torpedoes, shells, or bombs could send one to the bottom easily."/>
    <string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionLightCruiser" value="Developed in the latter half of the nineteenth century, the light cruiser is a class of armored warship defined by the London Treaty of 1930 as having guns of a caliber of about 6.1 inches or smaller. These ships typically serve as part of a larger fleet, working in tandem with larger warships to interdict convoys or enemy fleets. Alone, though, these small, maneuverable, yet capable warships have the capacity to decimate enemy shipping or even take on larger warships."/>
    <string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionHeavyCruiser" value="Heavy Cruisers, according to the London Treaty of 1930, are cruisers whose guns exceeded a caliber of 6.1 inches. These ships were typically armed with several 8 inch guns and designed for long range operations within a fleet. While faster than most other heavily armed ships such as battleships, they still lack that ship's awesome power."/>
    <string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionStandardBattleship" value="The Great Powers following Great War envisioned a world dominated by naval power: at the pinnacle of naval power, of course, stands the battleship. The core of any fleet, the battleship serves as the main platform of naval artillery, possessing the largest caliber guns of any ship in service. However, these juggernauts of the waves are limited by their size and, thus, speed, and work best when provided escort protection and reconnaissance from smaller craft."/>
    <string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionEscortCarrier" value="The escort carrier is an improvement over the initial light carriers fielded by navies after Great War: these inexpensive warships include more fighters, armor, and anti-aircraft defenses. However, they are slow and still easy prey for enemy ships and aircraft. These ships excel at running anti-submarine patrols and providing ground support to units conducting amphibious invasions."/>
    <string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionEscortDestroyers" value="Escort Destroyers are small, maneuverable and lightly-armed vessels charged primarily with escort of convoys. Typically armed with depth charges, these ships are charged with seeking out and destroying all enemy submarines which dare get close to the convoy. They are critical in any nation's fight to get supplies to critical junctures, but have little value as an independent craft outside of a fleet or convoy."/>
    <string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionFrigate" value="The naval warship frigate has had a long and storied history as part of the navies of the Great Powers since the dawn of the Age of Sail. The new frigate, however, shares little with these wooden warhorses of the oceans: these vessels are well-equipped with the latest in anti-submarine countermeasures in order to focus on eliminating any enemy subs. While well-armed and larger than other ships such as EarlyDestroyers, the frigate's slow speed make them ideal as part of a convoy, rather than working independently against submarines."/>
    <string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionFastBattleships" value="The fast battleship is a unique vessel in the ranks of world navies: while possessing the size and armament of normal battleships, these warships also place a heavy emphasis on speed and maneuverability. In due course, these vessels have expanded role vis-a-vis typical battleships as they are expected to break from the formations of the fleet and engage in independent, anti-ship interdiction. Designing these ships, however, remains challenging due to the difficulties of creating a quick, well-armed and armored ship, limiting their use in the world's navies."/>
    <string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionFleetCarrier" value="The Fleet Carrier represents a major advance in carrier design. In addition to having a stronger hull, more anti-aircraft defenses, and a higher speed, the ship can carry a large number of carrier planes. Furthermore, it can defend them well: the new armored decks of this carrier provide ample defense for the hangar bays of these ships. While still effective as part of a fleet, these ships can easily sustain enough planes to decimate enemy shipping and fleets."/>
    <string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionEarlySubmarines" value="First used in a military capacity during the late 18th century, early submarines have progressed far, especially in the last few decades of the 19th and 20th century. The invention of diesel power, the addition of periscopes, and the use of torpedoes have allowed submarines to become a major part of naval warfare. These vessels did prove their worth by decimating Allied shipping during the Great War: their future strategic importance, however, remains to be seen."/>
    <string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionShortRangeSubmarines" value="With advances in technology and the lessons learned from World War I, submarines have greatly extended their range in order to provide greater interdiction capabilities against enemy fleets. Advances in diesel motors, in addition to better torpedoes and sonar have allowed these vessels greater operational range. While still well-equipped for dealing with enemy convoys, they still remain prey against well-armed destroyers."/>
    <string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionLargeCruiser" value="The large cruiser is the closest class of ship to the battleship: these ships often equal the firepower of the battleship while being able to outmaneuver other cruisers. In due course, these cruiser-killers have the capacity to knock devastating blows to the entire range of ships. However, their firepower and speed makes for an expensive vessel which should be used cautiously against larger ships or groups of smaller yet more maneuverable cruisers and destroyers."/>
    <string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionAdvancedBattleship" value="Due to advances in nuclear and naval technology, many navies have scrapped the 'decisive doctrine' battle of naval warfare: naval warfare in the future, many contend, will be dominated by nuclear weapons and airpower. In due course, many navies have downgraded the role of battleships. However, advances in naval technology may still make them useful as these advanced battleships have stronger armor, higher speeds, and more powerful, longer range weapons. Will battleships serve as just fire support vessels, or will they reclaim their title as the pride of the world's navies?"/>
    <string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionAdvancedDestroyer" value="The new destroyers of the world's navies incorporate many of the advances in naval and anti-submarine technology that have occurred over the years. Critically, these new destroyers possess the latest in anti-submarine countermeasures, sonar, radar, and fully automatic main naval guns. While remaining most suited for protecting convoys or larger ships in a fleet, these new destroyers can serve critical reconnaissance and interdiction roles much better than their previous incarnations."/>
    <string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionLongRangeSubmarines" value="These submarines represent a major advance in naval technology: the battery power of these submarines has been advanced and the addition of snorkels that allow air to be funneled to engines has allowed these vessels to operate with a longer range than previous submarines. Furthermore, these advances have allowed these ships to become substantially stealthier, as they can stay under the water for longer periods of time, if not for the entirety of their voyage. Their main role remains the interdiction of supply convoys and enemy vessels, but they are a far better match against destroyers and anti-submarine aircraft which would easily sink their predecessors."/>
    <string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionSuperCarriers" value="The Super Carrier is the largest of all carriers, with sizes ranging from over 20,000 to 40,000 tons. Though still only armed for anti-aircraft defense, these carriers are the largest of all warships in any naval service. They have the capacity to carry the most squadrons of carrier planes of any aircraft carrier and, furthermore, have the greatest capacity to withstand punishment from enemy bombardment or bombing."/>
	<string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionNuclearCarrier" value="The biggest and best carrier unit in the game, these enormous ships can carry 5 naval air units.  They are even more capable of defending themselves from sea and air attack.  They are expensive to build and maintain, but capable inflicting enormous damage to sea and land targets, especially with more advanced naval air units aboard.  Use them as part of a fleet to project both sea and air power, or as part of a combined arms effort. The Nuclear Carrier has is capable of being out to sea for 100 turns before needing replenishment."/>
    <string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionAlpineWarfareTraining" value="Mountain warfare is one of the most dangerous types of warfare, with a combination of extreme altitudes and extreme weather making combat a very deadly affair. Training and equipping troops to operate in these environments is vital to success in harsh conditions and can make all the difference against a foe without similar training."/>
    <string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionImprovedTurboJets" value="With the advent of the axial compressor, turbojet engines can attain much higher altitudes and speeds that with the original centrifugal compressor. Planes using these engines can push the envelope of flight and achieve amazing results on and off the battlefield."/>
    <string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionIndirectFire" value="The concept of directing fire on an enemy from a distance is not a new one. However, during the First World War, rifled artillery, high explosives and forward target spotting made it much easier to direct large amounts of firepower onto an unseen enemy from very great distances."/>
    <string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionLargeHulledAircraft" value="With an increase in the physical size of an aircraft, it naturally translates into a greater capacity for carrying weapons of war, whether it be bombs, troops or vehicles. A large hull or fuselage for an aircraft is required for the larger plane designs and roles."/>
    <string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionNavalBombingTactics" value="While attacking vessels at sea from the air may seem similar to land targets, the very nature of the seas requires specialized equipment and specialized training to be effective. Tactical doctrine that is focused on air-to-sea operations is key to winning the war at sea."/>
    <string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionNavalInfantry" value="While infantry stationed on naval vessels have been a part of warfare since ancient times, only in the 20th century have haval operations reached a scale that requires specific training and doctrines to execute amphibious operations. Naval infantry in the 20th century are much less focused on ship security or ship capture, and are now mainly used to secure landing sites for invasion forces."/>
    <string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionSAMs" value="As the sheer volume of air power increased during the late years of the war, even the most determined anti-aircraft defenses found it difficult to stop the newer, faster and sturdier generation of aircraft dominating the skies. One solution to this problem is found in rocket science, where guided missiles moving at supersonic speeds intercept their targets at high altitude, well before they reach their intended targets."/>
    <string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionSpecializedInfantry" value="Attrition warfare is a military doctrine which focuses on wearing down one's opponents' men and material through combat, blockade, and other means. A controversial doctrine that has existed for millennia, military officials extensively employed this doctrine on the battlefields of World War I. This doctrine has taken into account many of the lessons of the war, yet many military theorists have criticized this doctrine as either unworkable or far too destructive as a result of modern wars. Only time will tell whether another military conflict will still employ this doctrine."/>
    <string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionInfiltration" value="Infiltration tactics developed during the course of the Great War in response to the stalemate of the attrition warfare of the East and West. Light, well-trained infantry such as German Stosstruppen would overwhelm key locations in enemy lines, leading the way for tank and infantry support to surround and decimate enemy lines. Though effective defensive countermeasures were developed in response to these tactical developments."/>
    <string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionGuerillaTactics" value="Guerilla, or 'little war' in Spanish, tactics originated during the Peninsular War in Spain against Napoleon's invading armies. These tactics focus on the use of small, mobile infantry units to launch quick strikes and ambushes against a larger force. While unconventional, these tactics typically weaken the enemy piecemeal and eventually help in turning the advantage to the attacking units, even if these units are heavily outnumbered. Typically, these tactics are used to great effect by defending units familiar with the lay of the land of one's country against invading enemy forces."/>
    <string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionMineSweeping" value="In order to remove mined areas of open waters, navies have tried to develop countermeasures that either destroy mines or eliminate their effectiveness. The mine sweep, typically done using a naval vessel, either cuts the mine loose from its mooring or comes in contact with the mine in order to safely destroy it. While still a dangerous enterprise due to the slow speed of these operations, thus making one vulnerable to artillery and aircraft, and the chance of accidentally blowing oneself up with a mine, mine sweeping remains a critical endeavor to any nation hoping to rule the waves."/>
    <string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionDeepDefense" value="Deep defense is a major development in tactical warfare that, though centuries old, saw a renaissance of use during the Great War. Instead of relying on one, strong line of defense against an enemy, an army will use a series of lightly defended lines that can easily fall back against an enemy assault. As an enemy attack loses momentum, defensive counterattacks can be more easily used. This tactic, in due course, helped to stall numerous offensive attacks on the battlefields of the Great War and should be used when conducting defensive operations in the future."/>
    <string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionHedgehogDefense" value="Hedgehog defenses seek to counteract against major offensive operations which could quickly overrun a country. Instead of fighting the offensive head-on with the full complement of soldiers, a military will allow use a deep defense strategy to allow the attackers to penetrate the defensive line. However, the strongpoints of the defensive line are expected to not fall and continue fighting, tying up enemy soldiers and allowing for reserves to surround these attacking soldiers and ensure a defensive victory."/>
    <string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionManeuverWarfare" value="Maneuver warfare attempts to counteract the notion that warfare is about the complete destruction of the enemy. Maneuver warfare focuses on using firepower and mobility of one's army in order to eliminate key enemy command-and-control and communications points. While this strategy may leave key parts of an enemy's military intact and still holding significant ground, maneuver warfare ultimately seeks to inCapacitate these forces by eliminating critical units and forcing the enemy to submit."/>
    <string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionDeepOperations" value="Deep Operations are an offensive doctrine which seeks to overwhelm an enemy's defensive line by launching a series of successive attacks deep within an enemy's formation. As gaps emerge in the enemy defensive lines, mobile units are deployed to exploit these breaks and eventually attack the enemy from behind. In due course, enemy forces are unable to redeploy defensive positions further in one's territory and the vast majority of the enemy defense, in theory, collapses."/>
    <string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionIndirectFires" value="Indirect fire is a method of artillery bombardment which does not rely on a direct sight of one's target. A military doctrine dating back from late 19th century, this tactic has often been used in tandem with a number of calculations of aiming and elevation in order to hit targets with little danger to the artillery crew. While still a difficult process, this type of artillery fire can inflict enormous damage on enemies from afar and without warning."/>
    <string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionAirborneRadar" value="Airborne radar systems are radar mounted on aircraft.

Within your borders the various warlords have left the national government of China weak; it's industrial level far behind that of other nations.  Now the Chinese Communist Party is growing in power, convinced that socialism is the best form of government for the Middle Kingdom. &#10;The Japanese threaten the blood of your people, while the Communist Chinese seek their allegiance.  With barely the forces to protect against one, which will it be?  Can you seek aid from other nations?  If so, who will help you oppose your internal and external threats?"/>
    <string id="SID.UI.NationDescription.TGQ.France" value="The Great War was a hollow victory for France.  The massive loss of manpower and industry only magnified the effects of the current global depression.  Your colonies in Africa and Indo-China have been a lodestone in recent years.  Internal political strife has further slowed rebuilding.  &#10;But now new threats are emerging closer to home.  Both Germany and Italy have adopted radical fascist ideologies.  With an Italian dictator wanting to create a New Roman Empire, and a new German chancellor rearming a rejuvenated Germany, can you muster the resources and manpower to maintain your once great empire or will France once again be a stage in the theater of war?"/>
    <string id="SID.UI.NationDescription.TGQ.Germany" value="You've just been named Chancellor of Germany.  After a decade of economic woe and humiliation caused by the Treaty of Versailles, it was easy to achieve power by fomenting the nationalism washing through Germany.  Now you can begin your plans to dominate Europe, and crush the hated communists to the east.  But Germany is weak.  To succeed you must rebuild your armies, develop industrial might, and stockpile resources for the conflicts to come.  &#10;You know rearmament will not sit well with the leaders of nearby nations, all of whom have the Great War still fresh in their minds.  Are European leaders really willing to go to war again to stop you?  Can you stall them while you create an invincible army?"/>
    <string id="SID.UI.NationDescription.TGQ.Italy" value="The fears of a socialist uprising similar to the Soviet Union have given you total control over Fascist Italy.  Now you must seek to expand your empire and build your under-developed industry.  Where to strike?  Ethiopia is a likely target.  Albania?  Yugoslavia?  Perhaps even Greece?  &#10;To the north, the new leadership in Germany has adopted your fascist ideology.  They could be a powerful ally in your quest for empire.  But how should you proceed without creating a war with France and England?  The wrong alliance could lead to ruin, but the right one could result in a reborn Roman Empire."/>
    <string id="SID.UI.NationDescription.TGQ.Japan" value="Manchuria is yours!  With this victory, Japan now has some of the resources within its borders to move out of its economic depression.  But how long will it be until these newly acquired resources are not enough to fuel the fires of Japanese industry? &#10;With the Chinese government now distracted by a communist uprising within, the invasion of the rest of China seems even more sweet.  Should you build your land forces and conquer the rest of China, or continue to modernize your powerful navy until it rivals Britain and the United States?  Resource-rich colonies lie spread to your south and west.  Will new conflicts close to home distract the UK and the Dutch and leave their imperial colonies vulnerable to conquest?"/>
    <string id="SID.UI.NationDescription.TGQ.UnitedKingdom" value="Although in decline since the Great War, your nation is the still most powerful empire on Earth, and your many colonies have helped reduce the economic effects of depression for your people.  But those colonies require all of your attention, and keep your superior navy widely dispersed.  &#10;Meanwhile, new threats are brewing in neighboring Europe, a result of the rise of the extremist ideologies of Communism and Fascism.  Germany is beginning to remilitarize in contravention of the Treaty of Versailles, and Italy has its own imperial ambitions.  Your far eastern colonies are threatened by regional instability and the growing naval power of Japan.  Can you contain the threats from across the globe?  Or will one or more rivals emerge to challenge your pre-eminent empire?"/>
    <string id="SID.UI.NationDescription.TGQ.UnitedStates" value="With America still neck deep in the Great Depression, your focus must be to rebuild your economy.  Your navy is strong but out-dated, and your army weak and lacking modern armor.  Should you invest in new forces at once, or will that drag down your fragile first steps towards economic recovery?  &#10;You are determined to avoid being drawn once more into the political intrigues of Europe--if you can.  Will America persevere on its own side of the world, or will the threat from foreign nations seeking to expand their power through conquest force America to ready itself for war once again?"/>
    <string id="SID.UI.NationDescription.TGQ.USSR" value="The massive industrial expansion you set in motion has been wildly successful, but at the cost of millions of lives due to widespread famine and brutal purges.  Variations of your revolutionary Communist ideology is taking hold in other nations, including China and Spain.  &#10;In Europe, Germany and Italy have popularized another radical new ideology: Fascism.  How can you help spread both your ideology, and your borders, without causing the Fascists or the western democracies to ally against you?  Can you use these opposing ideologies against one another, and have the USSR emerge as the dominant force in Europe?"/>
    <string id="SID.UI.NationDescription.TGQ.Default" value="The world, in the throes of the Great Depression casts a wary eye on Germany, now ruled by the deeply nationalist and anti-Communist National Socialist German Worker's Party. Their demagogic Fuhrer Adolf Hitler speaks loudly of peace between nations and a 'solemn pact of non-aggression', but the leaders of the world wonder, with trouble rising in the Far East and the League of Nations on the verge of collapse, whether peace can indeed be sustained. It is clear now that Germany is the key, and that The German Question must soon be answered either with words or guns."/>

    <string id="SID.UI.NationDescription.BFW.France" value="Since the depression of the early 30s, France has preferred to focus on economic growth, but international tensions demand your attention.&#10;Italy has conquered Ethiopia.  Germany has remilitarized the Rhineland and begun developing a powerful military.  The Germans have the might to back their aggressive words. Do you?  &#10;France does have diplomatic alliances.  You have woven a net of collective security, but have not tested its strength.  You have considered new alliances.  France shares goals with Britain, but Germany does not pose as immediate a threat to the island empire. The French government has long distrusted the Soviets, but they would make powerful allies.  &#10;Civil war has exploded in Spain. Should France come to the aid of the Spanish Republicans?  They are, like France, a Popular Front government. What will the rest of Europe do?"/>
    <string id="SID.UI.NationDescription.BFW.Germany" value="Soldiers have returned to the Rhineland.  The Wehrmacht has begun expansion.  Germany has returned to the world stage.&#10;The Versailles Treaty, imposed at the end of the Great War, was insulting and unfair.  You have begun restoring Germany's economic strength and international prestige.  You have proposed a Greater Germany, incorporating ethnic Germans from across Europe. Territorial expansion can highlight German superiority and bring you resources to fuel further growth.  The plan has Germany first taking control of Central Europe, then Eastern Europe.  Your ultimate ambition: to vanquish the USSR.&#10;Civil war has broken out in Spain.  The Fascist-influenced Nationalists will probably ask you to support their uprising. Will giving aid help or hinder your ambitions for Germany?  &#10;What will you do next, as you build your Third Reich?"/>
    <string id="SID.UI.NationDescription.BFW.Italy" value="Ethiopia is yours!  You have dreamed of an Italian Empire, equal to the glory of Ancient Rome.  With victory in Ethiopia, you avenged Italy's humiliation by the Abyssinians (Ethiopians) in 1896.  Triumphant, you have begun planning further expansion.  With an empire, Italy can achieve economic independence.  Until then, Italy has to import resources to expand its industry and military.&#10;You have also played the diplomatic game. The now-powerful Nazis borrowed much from your Fascist ideology.  You've considered alliance with Germany, but know your friends Britain and France would be displeased.&#10;The outbreak of civil war in Spain could change the diplomatic balance. You have pledged to support the Nationalists. Will you honor your word?  How will Britain, France, and Germany respond?"/>
    <string id="SID.UI.NationDescription.BFW.Japan" value="National pride and the need for raw materials have fueled expansionism in Japan.  Your factories rely on trade with the United States and United Kingdom, and will remain dependent on imports until Japan controls its own resources.  Your goal: economic control of Southeast Asia. &#10;You began by invading the Chinese province of Manchuria (Feng Tien, Heilungkiang, Jehol, and Kirin) in September 1931. The occupied land has been heavily industrialized and militarized, and can be a base for future incursions into China. &#10;Japanese expansion could disrupt the colonies and trading posts of Western nations.  Perhaps tensions in Europe will distract them from your maneuvers in Asia.  &#10;What are your next steps in China?  In Asia? How can you manipulate global affairs to Japan's advantage?"/>
    <string id="SID.UI.NationDescription.BFW.UnitedKingdom" value="The Versailles treaty lies in tatters; Germany has remilitarized the Rhineland and begun military expansion. In May, Italy officially annexed Ethiopia.  Flush with victory, Italian dreams appear unquenched.  You've watched German belligerence with concern, but painful memories of the Great War remain strong in Britain.  So, you've acted cautiously; made compromises, given concessions, and considered alliances.&#10;Halfway around the world, Japan's 1931 occupation of Manchuria hasn't satisfied Japanese hunger for land.  Further threats to China could endanger British territory and trade.  &#10;Civil war has broken out in Spain. When the combatants are Fascist Nationalists and the leftist Republican government, should Britain care who wins? &#10;Defending the British Empire has always been your most important goal.  As Germany, Italy, and Japan yearn to expand their borders, how will you defend yours?"/>
    <string id="SID.UI.NationDescription.BFW.UnitedStates" value="Isolationism.  Since the end of the Great War, US foreign policy has boiled down to that one word.  Although American leaders proposed the League of Nations, domestic resistance kept the US from joining the league.&#10;Before the stock market crash of 1929, America had been a major trade partner throughout the world. US banks helped Europe rise from the ashes of the Great War.  Following the Great Depression, Congress passed neutrality laws that prevented the US from supporting or joining any war.  America's domestic focus has left its military underfunded and out of date.&#10;You want to rehabilitate America's economy, but can you ignore global affairs?  International tensions could damage American trade; you've watched as Japanese aggressions endanger China and East Asia, and as German and Italian belligerence threaten Europe and Africa.   In an increasingly hostile world, how should America protect itself and its interests?"/>
    <string id="SID.UI.NationDescription.BFW.USSR" value="In 1917 the Communists wrested control from the tyrannical Czar. Since then, you have forced industrialization, abolished religion and private property, and staged public trials of alleged traitors, including some of the original revolutionaries.  The Soviet economy has joined the Industrial Revolution, though it still trails Europe's major powers. &#10;For years, the USSR has been an international pariah. No more. Western democracies have come calling. They fear your People's Republic, but know they need Soviet strength to counter German aggressions.  Germany threatens the USSR too. You can use your allies&quot; as they want to use you--to protect the Soviet Union from the Fascist menace.&#10;Civil war has broken out in Spain.  The Popular Front government is under attack from the Fascist Nationalists.  Should you help the Republicans?  How will it affect your international status?  This could prove your commitment to fighting Fascism.&quot;"/>
    <string id="SID.UI.NationDescription.BFW.Default" value="Prospects for peace continue to dim as the fires of war burn in Spain, Ethiopia and China. Germany has re-occupied the Rhineland, and sent a message that the peace that was guaranteed by the Versailles Treaty is now far less certain. The world watches and waits for now, but some nations, knowing what is to come, are quietly re-arming and building important alliances to ensure total victory in a future conflict. Peace may still rule the day, but the wise and prudent are Building for War."/>
    <string id="SID.UI.NationDescription.LDOP.China" value="For two years, the Japanese have been lords of the Chinese coast, brutally attacking and oppressing your people. &#10;Forced out of your capital and away from the economically vital coast, your strength is limited.  You've dedicated all of China to battling Japan; you've even declared a truce with your true enemy: the Chinese Communists. &#10;Western nations wring their hands and criticize Japan, but have sent little to your new capital, Chungking. Unlike the British and French, the United States is not threatened by the German menace. &#10;Is American aid your best hope?  How can you defend your territories and save your country?"/>
    <string id="SID.UI.NationDescription.LDOP.France" value="Appeasement has failed.  Germany controls Czechoslovakia.  The Nazis now threaten Poland . . . and could soon threaten France.  Can you ready French defenses?  France has the Maginot line fortifying the Franco-German border. North of the Ardennes, you share a border with the Belgians, who cling to neutrality. &#10;Halfway around the world, Japanese aggressions could threaten French trade and territories.  Can you protect France's colonies without weakening your domestic defenses?&#10;You've considered new defensive alliances, but with which countries?  The USSR?  Moscow has been distrustful and noncommittal.  Italy has drawn closer to Germany.  And Britain?  Can you trust it in a crisis? &#10;How can you contain Germany? More importantly, how can you protect France?"/>
    <string id="SID.UI.NationDescription.LDOP.Germany" value="German goals have been brutally simple. Greater Lebensraum (living space) for Germans. Take whatever land and resources Germany needs. Follow no one but yourself.  You agreed to nothing at Munich. Britain and France wanted false comfort, and you gave it to them. They gave you the Sudetenland, you promised to respect Czechoslovakia's borders.  You kept that pledge as long as--and no longer than--you wanted.&#10;Now Czechoslovakia belongs to Germany. Next on your list: Poland.  The liberation of Danzig, a German-speaking city, has been your justification for attack.  Your forces await your command.  They will then launch a blitzkrieg attack on Poland.  Will Britain and France come to Poland's defense?&#10;Germany is powerful, but potential enemies lie to the east and west.  The Great War taught you the danger of a two-front war.  The USSR also has eyed Polish lands. Perhaps you can use this to your advantage?  Alliance with those vile Communists would be detestable but practical.&#10;All shall hail your Third Reich!"/>
    <string id="SID.UI.NationDescription.LDOP.Italy" value="You have promised Italy a modern empire, one to rival the Roman Empire of centuries ago.  This proposed empire would rule the Mediterranean and be respected throughout the world! To accomplish this, you need a modern economy--and the resources to run it.&#10;Until your goal is achieved, Italy needs trade to fuel its factories.  Growing tensions between the UK, France, and Germany could threaten your import of resources.&#10;New conquests can bring glory and secure access to supplies. You've brought Albania under Italian control and considered attacking the Balkans and Greece.  Perhaps expanding Ethiopia's borders.  You've also dreamed of acquiring Britain and France's Mediterranean colonies, but do not dream of war with those major powers. &#10;Once Germany's mentor, you've found yourself increasingly in the Nazi shadow.  If Italy aligns with German plans, it should be as an equal partner, not a secondary ally.  What next steps are best for Italy?"/>
    <string id="SID.UI.NationDescription.LDOP.Japan" value="The Japanese invasion of China is nearly two years old.  Despite the strength and efficiency of your military, the Chinese still resist. &#10;Raw resources have fueled your campaign.  Supplies have come from the United States and the Asian mainland, but trade is not enough.  Territorial expansion can give Japan control of the resources you need to crush China. &#10;You have been willing to develop relationships with Germany and Italy.  Even better, you've used their aggressions to Japan's advantage. European conflicts have distracted Britain, France, and the Netherlands from your plans to conquer their resource-rich colonies.  Soviet forces have moved away from the Manchurian border to defend their western lands.  &#10;The United States has disapproved of your Chinese campaign.  There are rumors of embargos.  Japan needs resources and does not need new enemies. What will you do next?"/>
    <string id="SID.UI.NationDescription.LDOP.UnitedKingdom" value="The British Empire faces a deeply troubled world.  In Asia, Japan has begun building its own empire.  Japanese aggressions threaten British territories and trade.  However, the larger danger grows in Europe.&#10;The peace brokered at Munich has been shattered.

Poland is far away, and Germany far more prepared than Britain.&#10;You have considered building a strong alliance with France, but the French have been focused on domestic defense and not broader strategies.  What of the USSR?  It would be a powerful ally, but Britain has never trusted the expansionist Communist state.  The United States could be a valuable partner, but American neutrality seems unbreakable&#10;Will you allow Germany to dominate Europe?  Will you protect your Asian empire from Japanese ambitions? The world is changing.  How will Britain respond?"/>
    <string id="SID.UI.NationDescription.LDOP.UnitedStates" value="Years of unemployment and economic woe have ground down American optimism. Foreign involvement?  Absolutely not.  Immigration restrictions and neutrality laws made isolationism the American way.&#10;America has resisted engaging with the world, but global tensions have touched your shores.  Japan has been the biggest threat; its continued invasion of China could disrupt American trade and power in the Pacific. There are also rumbles from Europe.  A defiant and rearmed Germany seems poised to dominate the Continent.&#10;Slowly, you have begun to rebuild the American military, starting with the naval forces that would be crucial to any Pacific war&#10;Rebuilding the American economy has been your top priority.  Can America continue its domestic focus, or must it engage with the world?"/>
    <string id="SID.UI.NationDescription.LDOP.USSR" value="Communism should sweep across the globe, overthrowing corrupt democracies.  But, before that happens, you want to secure power closer to home.  &#10;There are perils on all sides.  An aggressive Japan with troops near Siberia.  A rearmed Nazi Germany in the west. &#10;To strengthen Soviet borders, you've considered putting troops in buffer zones in eastern Poland, the Baltic States, and Finland's Karelian Peninsula.  Will you move forces to those lands through treaty . . . or conquest? &#10;The USSR stands alone in the world. Ever since 1917, London, Paris, and Washington have conspired against your great revolution.  You don't need enemies masquerading as friends.

Austria and Czechoslovakia now fall under the orbit of the Reich, and it is not certain now whether they will be the last to do so. In the Far East, China has been brought low by the boot heel of the Japanese Army, and will not be able to stand on its own for long without help from other nations.

As they fight, you&apos;ve conserved China&apos;s strength for battle against the Communists.&#010;&#010;However, while China evaded conflicts with Japan, the Communist Party filled the vacuum. The Communists have fought a guerrilla war against the Japanese invaders and now control Chinese territories.&#010;&#010;Will you continue down this path?

    <string id="SID.UI.NationDescription.TGF.France" value="In June 1940, the French Republic surrendered to Nazi Germany.  A Fascist-allied government set up a new capital in Vichy, while supporters of the democratic Republic established the Free French forces in exile.  &#010;&#010;Since then, La Resistance has battled Vichy and German forces within and outside of France.  Although German forces occupied the whole of France in 1942, the Free French continued to fight.&#010;&#010;Has the tide turned against the Nazi occupiers?  The USSR has pushed Germany back from Moscow, almost out of Soviet territory.  The Allies are prepared to launch a major invasion of the French mainland.  They also are ready to recognize Free France as the legitimate government of France.  How can you help regain your homeland?  How will you position Italy in a realigned world?"/>
    <string id="SID.UI.NationDescription.TGF.Germany" value="Since Anschluss with Austria, Germany has dominated Europe.  The Nazi flag flew across the Continent.  The flag no longer flies high, as German achievements have begun slipping away.  &#010;&#010;After too many cold, cruel battles, the Red Army has thrown Germany out of Soviet lands.  Soviet forces have begun push west.  &#010;&#010;Italy has fallen.  The Italians were weak allies, but allies nonetheless.  With their defeat, Anglo-American forces can focus on Germany.  British and American bombers have been pulverizing German cities for years.  Now their ground forces can join the fight.&#010;&#010;The Third Reich&apos;s borders are at risk.  Where next will the Allied powers attack?  How can Germany respond?"/>
    <string id="SID.UI.NationDescription.TGF.Italy" value="In 1943, Fascist Italy collapsed under the weight of an Anglo-American attack.  The Fascist ex-leader fled, and Italy signed a peace agreement with the Allies.  &#010;&#010;You have marshalled Italy&apos;s military and now fight alongside the Allies.   Italy is not free from Fascism.  Germany holds tight to northern regions, and wants to return Fascist leaders to power.  The Allies are committed to defeating German troops on Italian soil.  &#010;&#010;What role does an Allied Italy have in this fight?  Can the Germans be driven out of Italian lands?  How can you rebuild Italy for a post-war world?"/>
    <string id="SID.UI.NationDescription.TGF.Japan" value="In a few fast years, Japan has built an empire. You used surprise and force to bring America and Britain to their knees.  You have wrested resources from the colonies of Southeast Asia.&#010;&#010;Although the US and UK have a &quot;Europe First&quot; battle plan, their navies have recovered from the attacks of December 1941, and threaten Japan&apos;s command of Asia. &#010;&#010;The Americans and British have also allied with China.  Since 1937, that vast country has swallowed Japanese troops, resources, and ambitions.  Despite China&apos;s weak military and infrastructure, and despite Japanese control of China&apos;s territories, cities, and ports, you have been unable to force a Chinese surrender. &#010;&#010;After seven years of attrition, what should Japan do?  Can you crush the Chinese?  As American and British troops pour into Asia, can you hold or expand the Japanese empire?"/>
    <string id="SID.UI.NationDescription.TGF.UnitedKingdom" value="The war turns in Britain&apos;s favor: Italy has surrendered, British forces have reconquered Burma, and American forces are, island by island, taking back the Pacific.&#010;&#010;Now, on your shores, British and American forces have assembled for a D-Day invasion. From your air fields, British and American bombers are ready for flight.  When you give the command, British soldiers will attack Germany on the Continent.  You will open the Western battlefront.&#010;&#010;A difficult struggle lies ahead, and already Britain has paid a heavy price. Bombings and battles have damaged the British economy and war has weakened your grip on Britain&apos;s far-flung empire.  What of your allies? The US has emerged as an economic and military superpower. The USSR, with forces pushing into Eastern Europe, could seek a sphere of Soviet dominance. &#010;&#010;How can you use your partners&apos; strengths to your advantage?  How can you win this war?"/>
    <string id="SID.UI.NationDescription.TGF.UnitedStates" value="Since December of 1941 the US has fought a total war on two fronts. American factories have performed marvelously and continue to expand production. &#010;&#010;American troops are reconquering the Pacific atoll by atoll, island by island.  The Japanese have been dedicated fighters, but America outmatches them in technology and supplies.  What steps will you take next in your Pacific war?&#010;&#010;With your British allies, you forced Italy to surrender.  Now the fight in Europe can focus on Germany.  Your D-Day plan is ready.  American troops are in England, and they are eager to strike.  They only await your commands.&#010;&#010;And what of the Soviet Union?  You&apos;ve never trusted your Communist ally. The Soviets always hungered for territory and power.  America has fought this war for democracy and freedom, not for Communism.  &#010;&#010;With each victory over the Axis, you grow closer to the post-war world.  What shape will this new world take?"/>
    <string id="SID.UI.NationDescription.TGF.USSR" value="The USSR has suffered a staggering twenty million casualties in this war, but the tides of battle have turned. In 1941, Germany almost took Moscow.  Now Germany is in retreat, as Soviet forces push westward.  &#010;&#010;In little more than a century, European leaders have launched three invasions of your country. You have learned from these assaults.  Without better western defenses, the USSR might always be at risk.   &#010;&#010;After the Great War, Europe tried to establish a cordon sanitaire (quarantine line) of anti-Soviet countries in Eastern Europe. To defend your borders, should you copy that plan? Wherever the Red Army vanquishes German power, you establish a Communist regime?   &#010;&#010;Allied powers have sought Soviet help in the Pacific, but they also fear your strength.  You can choose to enter that war on your own schedule, and with your own agenda: expanding Soviet power in East Asia."/>
    <string id="SID.UI.NationDescription.TGF.Default" value="After years of victory, has the balance of power shifted away from the Axis?  Japan&apos;s empire has begun to contract, as American and British forces push across the Pacific.   &#010;&#010;In Europe, Italy has surrendered and the USSR has ousted German soldiers from Soviet territory.  Germany still controls Western Europe, but American and British forces have planned a major invasion.  Their troops are gathered together and ready to open a Western battlefront.  &#010;&#010;War has united the US, UK, and USSR.  But, shared enemies do not guarantee shared goals.
