They have the greatest range and do the most damage even with a conventional warhead.  When equipped with an atomic or nuclear warhead, they will destroy an entire city."/>
	<string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionFissionBombs" value="The fission nuclear bomb seeks to create a massive explosion using energy derived from splitting the nucleus of an atom into smaller parts. This process creates a chain reaction wherein a massive amount of energy is produced that propels the explosive power of the bomb. These bombs truly are weapons of mass destruction: they are capable of devastating armies, cities, and navies with the initial explosion and leaving dangerous, debilitating fallout that can weaken and destroy life and make key enemy regions impassable. One bomb could easily kill hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people."/>
	<string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionHydrogenBombs" value="Hydrogen bombs, using a mixture of heavy hydrogen isotopes, do the reverse of fission bombs: nuclear fusion. In the process of nuclear fusion, the fusion process creates a chain reaction that ultimately more than double the energy release of fission bombs. In due course, the destructive potential of hydrogen bombs is massive: a nation can easily eliminate vast armies, armadas, or metropolises in the blink of an eye, leaving nuclear devastation and destruction affecting the country for years to come."/>

Use them at the core of offensive task forces to decimate other fleets from a distance."/>
	<string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionEarlySubmarines" value="Submarines are the only sea vessels capable of remaining hidden in a sea region that contains an enemy fleet.  Even these early subs have a decent chance to hit ships with their torpedoes, although the limited damage requires multiple hits to sink a large ship, unless the sub scores a critical hit.  They are also useful as recon vessels, monitoring the sea lanes to spot fleets on the move."/>
	<string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionShortRangeSubmarines" value="Improved torpedoes allow these subs to deliver more damage then Early Subs, with double the chance for a critical hit to instantly sink an enemy ship.  They are undetectable until they attack, unless the enemy fleet contains destroyers.  Placing them in trade lanes will interdict a percentage of trade goods, and the effect is cumulative, so the more subs present, the more goods will be destroyed."/>
	<string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionLargeCruiser" value="This is the vessel that truly makes the Dreadnought obsolete.  It is just as tough, does comparable damage, is faster, takes less time to build and less money to maintain.

Though effective defensive countermeasures were developed in response to these tactical developments."/>
	<string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionGuerillaTactics" value="Guerilla, or 'little war' in Spanish, tactics originated during the Peninsular War in Spain against Napoleon's invading armies. These tactics focus on the use of small, mobile infantry units to launch quick strikes and ambushes against a larger force. While unconventional, these tactics typically weaken the enemy piecemeal and eventually help in turning the advantage to the attacking units, even if these units are heavily outnumbered. Typically, these tactics are used to great effect by defending units familiar with the lay of the land of one's country against invading enemy forces."/>
	<string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionMineSweeping" value="In order to remove mined areas of open waters, navies have tried to develop countermeasures that either destroy mines or eliminate their effectiveness. The mine sweep, typically done using a naval vessel, either cuts the mine loose from its mooring or comes in contact with the mine in order to safely destroy it. While still a dangerous enterprise due to the slow speed of these operations, thus making one vulnerable to artillery and aircraft, and the chance of accidentally blowing oneself up with a mine, mine sweeping remains a critical endeavor to any nation hoping to rule the waves."/>
	<string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionDeepDefense" value="Deep defense is a major development in tactical warfare that, though centuries old, saw a renaissance of use during the Great War. Instead of relying on one, strong line of defense against an enemy, an army will use a series of lightly defended lines that can easily fall back against an enemy assault. As an enemy attack loses momentum, defensive counterattacks can be more easily used. This tactic, in due course, helped to stall numerous offensive attacks on the battlefields of the Great War and should be used when conducting defensive operations in the future."/>

	<string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionDeepOperations" value="Deep Operations are an offensive doctrine which seeks to overwhelm an enemy's defensive line by launching a series of successive attacks deep within an enemy's formation. As gaps emerge in the enemy defensive lines, mobile units are deployed to exploit these breaks and eventually attack the enemy from behind. In due course, enemy forces are unable to redeploy defensive positions further in one's territory and the vast majority of the enemy defense, in theory, collapses. Following the large-scale amphibious warfare of the Great War, the Great Powers continued the improvement of amphibious landing training for military personnel to better reach enemy territory and immediately begin combat operations upon hitting shore."/>
	<string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionIndirectFires" value="Indirect fire is a method of artillery bombardment which does not rely on a direct sight of one's target. A military doctrine dating back from late 19th century, this tactic has often been used in tandem with a number of calculations of aiming and elevation in order to hit targets with little danger to the artillery crew. While still a difficult process, this type of artillery fire can inflict enormous damage on enemies from afar and without warning."/>

Even so, they are constructed roadways, and so increase the speed of units moving through the region significantly compared to areas with no roads at all.  They are quick and inexpensive to build"/>
	<string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionRailroads" value="The invention of steam-powered locomotives in the nineteenth century led to a massive worldwide expansion in the use of railroads. They do require twice the manpower of simple unpaved roads, but they are fairly quick and inexpensive to build.  Railroads double the speed of unit movement in the region compared to unpaved roads."/>
	<string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionPavedRoadways" value="Modern paved roads, made of such materials as asphalt, are very efficient at creating avenues of transportation for foot traffic, horses, and, importantly, automobiles. Though more expensive and slower to build than railroads, they are measurably faster than railroads yet require the same amount of manpower to construct."/>
	<string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionHighways" value="Highways are any main road which connects major locations within or between regions.

	<string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionFortifiedDefenseLine" value="A fortified defense line is the pinnacle of defensive fortifications on land: a combination of earthworks, concrete bunkers, pillboxes, and fortified artillery emplacements. As would be expected, these large scale fortifications are time-consuming and expensive, and require significant manpower to construct.  In return they offer units the best defensive bonus for a region upgrade in the game."/>
	<string id="SID.UI.EncyclopediaDescriptionAntiAirBatteries" value="Anti-air batteries are the first regional upgrade that can defend against attacking aircraft.  Although their limited number of shots can allow a large force to penetrate, against a lower number of air units these batteries are highly effective, especially in the early game."/>

    <!-- Scenario Nation Descriptions -->
    <string id="SID.UI.NationDescription.Generic" value="Empty or Grid Default Description"/>
    <string id="SID.UI.NationDescription.TGQ.Albania" value="The new leaders of Fascist Italy feel robbed by the outcome of WW1 and are now in the midst of preparing for something nefarious. Albania has been forced to maintain good relations with Italy while watching her shipping and trade be concessioned by the Italian authorities. Italy's new government envies Albania's strategicly significant ports and it is unlikely Yugoslavia and Greece would risk getting involved to come to Albania's aid. &#010;The German Question will influence Italy and Albania might not be able to appease the hungry fascist infringing on her and the rest of Europe."/>
    <string id="SID.UI.NationDescription.TGQ.China" value="Manchuria is lost, and an uneasy peace now holds between your nation and the hated Japanese.  Alas, they are not your only adversary.  Within your borders the various warlords have left the national government of China weak; it's industrial level far behind that of other nations.  Now the Chinese Communist Party is growing in power, convinced that socialism is the best form of government for the Middle Kingdom. &#010;The Japanese threaten the blood of your people, while the Communist Chinese seek their allegiance.  With barely the forces to protect against one, which will it be?  Can you seek aid from other nations?  If so, who will help you oppose your internal and external threats?"/>
    <string id="SID.UI.NationDescription.TGQ.ComChina" value="The militias have been marshaled and it's time for the long march. Supply can only reach your forces in the region of Kiangsi due to the Nationalist's recent encircling operation. Should you spread out your weak militias to try and conquer cities, or should you hold on to what cities you have and build up your forces? There are rumors of a new initiative to squash any remaining armed resistance by the new year. If you convince the Soviets and Japanese to get involved or to send aid there may be ulterior motives. The people of Communist China hold YOU as their leader, will you bring them to victory?"/>
    <string id="SID.UI.NationDescription.TGQ.France" value="The Great War was a hollow victory for France.  The massive loss of manpower and industry only magnified the effects of the current global depression.  Your colonies in Africa and Indo-China have been a lodestone in recent years.  Internal political strife has further slowed rebuilding.  &#010;But now new threats are emerging closer to home.  Both Germany and Italy have adopted radical fascist ideologies.  With an Italian dictator wanting to create a New Roman Empire, and a new German chancellor rearming a rejuvenated Germany, can you muster the resources and manpower to maintain your once great empire or will France once again be a stage in the theater of war?"/>
    <string id="SID.UI.NationDescription.TGQ.Germany" value="You've just been named Chancellor of Germany.  After a decade of economic woe and humiliation caused by the Treaty of Versailles, it was easy to achieve power by fomenting the nationalism washing through Germany.  Now you can begin your plans to dominate Europe, and crush the hated communists to the east.  But Germany is weak.  To succeed you must rebuild your armies, develop industrial might, and stockpile resources for the conflicts to come.  &#010;You know rearmament will not sit well with the leaders of nearby nations, all of whom have the Great War still fresh in their minds.  Are European leaders really willing to go to war again to stop you?  Can you stall them while you create an invincible army?"/>
    <string id="SID.UI.NationDescription.TGQ.Italy" value="The fears of a socialist uprising similar to the Soviet Union have given you total control over Fascist Italy.  Now you must seek to expand your empire and build your under-developed industry.  Where to strike?  Ethiopia is a likely target.  Albania?  Yugoslavia?  Perhaps even Greece?  &#010;To the north, the new leadership in Germany has adopted your fascist ideology.  They could be a powerful ally in your quest for empire.  But how should you proceed without creating a war with France and England?  The wrong alliance could lead to ruin, but the right one could result in a reborn Roman Empire."/>
    <string id="SID.UI.NationDescription.TGQ.Japan" value="Manchuria is yours!  With this victory, Japan now has some of the resources within its borders to move out of its economic depression.  But how long will it be until these newly acquired resources are not enough to fuel the fires of Japanese industry? &#010;With the Chinese government now distracted by a communist uprising within, the invasion of the rest of China seems even more sweet.  Should you build your land forces and conquer the rest of China, or continue to modernize your powerful navy until it rivals Britain and the United States?  Resource-rich colonies lie spread to your south and west.  Will new conflicts close to home distract the UK and the Dutch and leave their imperial colonies vulnerable to conquest?"/>
    <string id="SID.UI.NationDescription.TGQ.UnitedKingdom" value="Although in decline since the Great War, your nation is the still most powerful empire on Earth, and your many colonies have helped reduce the economic effects of depression for your people.  But those colonies require all of your attention, and keep your superior navy widely dispersed.  &#010;Meanwhile, new threats are brewing in neighboring Europe, a result of the rise of the extremist ideologies of Communism and Fascism.  Germany is beginning to remilitarize in contravention of the Treaty of Versailles, and Italy has its own imperial ambitions.  Your far eastern colonies are threatened by regional instability and the growing naval power of Japan.  Can you contain the threats from across the globe?  Or will one or more rivals emerge to challenge your pre-eminent empire?"/>
    <string id="SID.UI.NationDescription.TGQ.UnitedStates" value="With America still neck deep in the Great Depression, your focus must be to rebuild your economy.  Your navy is strong but out-dated, and your army weak and lacking modern armor.  Should you invest in new forces at once, or will that drag down your fragile first steps towards economic recovery?  &#010;You are determined to avoid being drawn once more into the political intrigues of Europe--if you can.  Will America persevere on its own side of the world, or will the threat from foreign nations seeking to expand their power through conquest force America to ready itself for war once again?"/>
    <string id="SID.UI.NationDescription.TGQ.USSR" value="The massive industrial expansion you set in motion has been wildly successful, but at the cost of millions of lives due to widespread famine and brutal purges.  Variations of your revolutionary Communist ideology is taking hold in other nations, including China and Spain.  &#010;In Europe, Germany and Italy have popularized another radical new ideology: Fascism.  How can you help spread both your ideology, and your borders, without causing the Fascists or the western democracies to ally against you?  Can you use these opposing ideologies against one another, and have the USSR emerge as the dominant force in Europe?"/>
    <string id="SID.UI.NationDescription.TGQ.Default" value="The world, in the throes of the Great Depression casts a wary eye on Germany, now ruled by the deeply nationalist and anti-Communist National Socialist German Worker's Party. Their demagogic Fuhrer Adolf Hitler speaks loudly of peace between nations and a 'solemn pact of non-aggression', but the leaders of the world wonder, with trouble rising in the Far East and the League of Nations on the verge of collapse, whether peace can indeed be sustained. It is clear now that Germany is the key, and that The German Question must soon be answered either with words or guns."/>
